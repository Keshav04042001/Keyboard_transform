# Keyboard_transform

The goal is to write a program that performs a simple encoding of a large volume of text. Part of the application is a set of 3 character transform functions. These transforms apply to a 4 row x 10 column section of keys on a standard qwerty keyboard. The 4 rows start with 1, q, a, z and extend to 0, p, ;, /, respectively. There are 3 types transforms that can be specified:

### Horizontal Flip: This transformation will flip all rows of the keyboard horizontally (e.g., the 1 will swap with the 0, the 2 with the 9, etc.)

### Vertical Flip: This transformation will flip all columns of the keyboard vertically (e.g., the 1 will swap with the z, the q with the a, the 2 with the x, etc.)

### Shift: This transformation should take in an integer N and perform a linear shift of the keyboard. Each key should shift N places to its right if N > 0 (and likewise to the left if N < 0). If a key would move past it's current row then it should shift into the row below, and so on. So for example, for N = 5, the last five keys (nm,./ would move into the first 5 places of the top row, the 12345 would move 5 places to the right, 67890 would move to the start of the 2nd row, and so on).

The transforms can be chained. For example, we might call your program and specify: horizontal flip (H) vertical flip (V) horizontal flip (H) shift by 5 (5) vertical flip (V) shift by -12 (-12). The input for this would be H,V,H,5,V,-12. In that case, each transform would be applied to the output of the previous transform.

Horizontal flips are encoded by an H, vertical by a V, and shifts by an integer.
